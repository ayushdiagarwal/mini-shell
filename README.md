# **Pintu Shell**

A lightweight command-line shell written in C that demonstrates core Operating System concepts including process creation, system calls, I/O handling, and command execution.

---

## Overview

**Pintu Shell** is a simplified Unix-like shell built as an academic Operating Systems project.
The shell supports:

* Executing Linux external commands (`ls`, `cat`, `grep`, etc.)
* Built-in commands to control the shell environment (`cd`, `echo`, `help`, etc.)
* Interactive input loop similar to Bash

This project focuses on how a shell parses commands, creates processes, interacts with the OS through system calls, and handles basic user interaction.

---

## Objectives

This project demonstrates key OS concepts:

* **System Calls:** `fork()`, `execvp()`, `waitpid()`, `chdir()`, `getcwd()`, etc.
* **Process Management:** launching child processes and synchronizing using `wait()`
* **Command Parsing:** tokenizing input using delimiters
* **Built-in command execution vs. external binary execution**

## Sample Usage

```
pintu> pwd
/home/ayush

## 🧠 System Calls Used

| System Call | Purpose                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `fork()`    | Create a child process             |
| `execvp()`  | Execute external binary programs   |
| `waitpid()` | Wait for child process completion  |
| `chdir()`   | Change working directory           |
| `getcwd()`  | Retrieve current working directory |
| `getline()` | Read user input                    |
| `strtok()`  | Tokenize input arguments           |
